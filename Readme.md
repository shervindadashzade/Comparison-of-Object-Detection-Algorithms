# A Comparison of Different Deep Learning Architechtures On Coral Reef Detection
This project is inspired by the prior work of Mahdi Kashanipour in this context [(link)](https://github.com/m-kashani/MS_Project). I found it a solid foundation to experiment and review different Object Detection network architectures such as **RetinaNet, ResNet,  and YOLO**, as well as examine the effect of **Data Augmentation** on the context of underwater coral ref data. The scientific method used in the document written by him is compelling enough for me to take my first steps toward this goal.
